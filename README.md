# StudentRoster

This project involves creating a C++ application to help a university migrate an existing student system to a new platform. The core task is to implement the functionality to manage and manipulate student data within a course roster system.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project Breakdown:
Core Requirement: The application will use two key classes:

Student: Represents individual students, storing attributes such as student ID, name, email, age, an array of days spent on each course, and the degree program.
Roster: Manages a collection of students. It stores an array (classRosterArray) containing multiple Student objects and supports operations like reading data, adding students, and manipulating the data for specific output.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Features:

Data Parsing and Storage: The program will read a list of student data (including fields like student ID, name, age, days to complete courses, etc.), parse the data, and create corresponding Student objects. These objects will be stored in an array.
Manipulation: Function calls will allow data to be manipulated. For example, adding, removing, or updating students, as well as querying specific information such as the average number of days a student takes to complete their courses.
Data Display: The program will output specific student data to the console based on given requirements, demonstrating how to access and display the relevant information.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Skills Demonstrated:

Object-oriented programming (OOP) with class design and implementation.
Effective data parsing and processing.
Understanding of arrays, pointers, and memory management in C++.
Console-based user output to show the manipulations performed on the student data.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tools and IDE:

The project is developed using Visual Studio, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and integrating debugging tools for smooth development.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Expected Deliverables:

A zip file containing all necessary code files, including the student and roster class files.
Clear project structure with IDE-specific files for easy compilation and execution.
